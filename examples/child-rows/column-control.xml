<title lib="Responsive">Column controlled child rows</title>

<info><![CDATA[

Responsive has two built in methods for displaying the controlling element of the child rows; `inline` which is the default option and shows the control in the first column, and `column` which sets a _control column_ as the control. The control column is shown only when there is some other column hidden, and is dedicated only to the show / hide control for the rows.

This example shows the `r-init responsive.details.type` option set to `column` to activate the control column. Note that by default the first column is used as the control, so additionally in the initialisation the `dt-init order` and `dt-init columns.orderable` options are used to disable sorting on this column along with using the class `dtr-control` so it received the correct styling options.
