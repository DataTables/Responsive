<info><![CDATA[

Responsive has the ability to display the details that it has hidden in a variety of different ways. Its default is to allow the end user to toggle the the display by clicking on a row and showing the information in a DataTables child row. At times it can be useful not to require end user interaction to display the hidden data in a responsive manner, which can be done with the `childRowImmediate` display type.

Display types are set using the `r-init responsive.details.display` option which should point to a function that will handle the child row display. The built in options are available in the `$.fn.dataTable.Responsive.display` object. See `r-init responsive.details.display` for a full list of the options available.

Additionally, the `r-init responsive.details.type` option is set to be an empty string in this example to disable the user's ability to toggle the child rows - i.e. in this example the full contents of the table are always visible. This could be removed if you want to retain that ability.
