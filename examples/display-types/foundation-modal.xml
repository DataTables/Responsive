<info><![CDATA[

This example shows the `r-init responsive.details.display` option being used with the `modal` option, which, when used with the Foundation integration for Responsive, will use Foundation's native modal display.

The built-in `modal` display option should be executed as a function with optional parameters passed in to control the behaviour of the modal display. In the case of Foundation it has only a `header` option which is a function that should return the title for the modal. If you do not wish to display a title, simply don't use this option.

Additionally, the `r-init responsive.details.renderer` option is used here to display the full data for the row, rather than just the hidden columns (which is the default behaviour) as this looks a bit better in a modal!
