<info><![CDATA[

This example shows how Responsive can be used with server-side processing in DataTables to cope with very large tables. No special considerations are required, just initialise Responsive as you normally would!

Please note that the table's container has been artificially reduced in width for this example to make sure that Responsive hides columns for the demo!
