		<description>
			The priority is an integer value where lower numbers are given a higher priority (i.e. a column with priority 2 will be hidden before a column with priority 1).

			It is expected that the priority given should be >=0, but it is technically possible to use negative numbers to increase priority for important columns.

	<default value="undefined">
		The default value for this parameter is `-type undefined`. When Responsive finds an undefined priority value it will automatically set the column's priority to 10000.

		<![CDATA[
		Responsive will automatically remove columns from the right-hand-side of the table when a table is too wide for a given display. Although this is a useful default, you may want to control the order in which columns are hidden. This parameter provides that ability by setting a visibility priority order.

		The value given will set the column's visibility priority with a lower number representing a higher priority in terms of staying visible in the table. For example a column with a priority of 2 will be removed from the display before a column with priority 1, regardless of the order that they appear in the table.

		This can be particularly useful for cases where you wish to keep the right-hand column(s) visible if they contain action buttons or other important information.

		The column priority can also be defined by a `data-priority` attribute on the column's header cell (for example `-tag <th data-priority="1">First name</th>`). If both a `data-priority` attribute and a `r-init columns.responsivePriority` value has been set for a single column, the `r-init columns.responsivePriority` value will always be used.
